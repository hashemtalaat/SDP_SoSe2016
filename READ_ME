Hello everyone, 

To keep things clean, I propose that everyone has their own log file
in a separetly directory located inside collaborators.
(see octavio directory for example). 

Also all the progress done for the tasks will be located in the "tasks" 
directory which I propose gets divided by weeks and everyone can modify

Finally in the TO_DO file I think it would be a good idea if everyone
can add their names corresponding the task they are working on.
